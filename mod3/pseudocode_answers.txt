2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: It would not work on a computer. Because it is an informal language and is just meant for human eyes to read. 

Programming Assignment- write the following algorithms in pseudocode: 

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number. 

FUNCTION printBiggerNumber 
INPUT first number
INPUT second number 
IF first number is greater than second number
	PRINT first number
ELSE second number is greater than first number
	PRINT second number 

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100. 

FUNCTION printHUNDRED
set a maximum at 100
INPUT number starting at 1 
WHILE the number is <100
	ADD +1 to the previous number
	INPUT a number
PRINT number 
END WHILE when reached 100. 

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook. 

FUNCTION findEntry
IF entry === matchInPhoneBook
	PRINT matchInPhoneBook info 
ELSE 
	PRINT "entry not found"

4. function findEntry {
	if (entry === ""){ 
	return entry + "" + info; 
    } else {
	return "Entry not found." ; 
	}
}
