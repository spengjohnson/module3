1. In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important. 

A: Clean code is important for many reasons. The biggest thing that I think of when it comes to clean code, is that it is READABLE for other developers. Someone else can pick and where you left off without having to ask a bunch of questions or sort through what you are trying to accomplish in the code. Clean code is also not redundant, and is as concise as it can be (DRY code). It's kind of like having an easy-to-understand file system, where any front desk receptionist can understand the organization method and all the labels that are used to contain everything.

A: Blood glucose meters use computers in order to help read a person's blood sugar. People use these devices in order to manage their chronic disease, and make decisions based on those readings. If for some reason the code in the meter was so inaccurate that it didn't provide accurate readings, it would definitely lead to people making bad decisions about how to handle their blood sugars. For example, if it read that it was too low, then an individual might treat a "low" blood sugar for no reason. On the other hand, if a person has a high blood sugar, it might cause them to take too much insulin, or cause panic and go to an emergency room. 

3. Code: 
FUNCTION doSomething(x, y)               // Creating a new function
 IF y = "F" THEN               // Check if y is equal "F"
 SET z to (xâˆ’32) * (5/9)       // Formula to convert degrees fahrenheit to celsius
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 ELSE { THEN          // If y not equal to "F", check if equal to "C"
 SET z to x * 1.8000 + 32.00 }  // Formula to convert degrees celsius to fahrenheit
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 END IF
END FUNCTION


A: I've added some notes above to refactor the code. I think that the function name could use a noun, vs. just having it be called "do". The "do" name alone is not meaningful enough for someone to know what it's GOING to do. I think that this could also just be a simple IF ELSE, vs. having an "else if" at the end. I think what would also help is if the parameters passed through were better defined.

4. Code: 
FUNCTION calcPercent(sum, total)
 IF NOT(total = 0) THEN
     SET percentage to sum / total * 100
 ELSE
   PRINT "Sorry, cannot divide by 0"
 END IF

 PRINT percentage
END FUNCTION

A: Changes
	- I would call the function calculatePercent instead of the abbreviation. 
	- IF NOT (total=0) should just be IF (total = 0) as that isn't proper logic or syntax. 
	

5. Using pseudocode, refactor the code for the following examples. 
a. 
FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + totalDue

   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Change due: " + amount - totalDue
   ELSE paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + totalDue
END IF
END FUNCTION

totalDue = subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)

b. I don't see that this needs any modification. The function name is written with a verb, meaningful and I understood it at first glance. In fact, as I read through the function it is very clear what's happening throughout. It is all easy to read, understand and follow. If the account is active, and the guest has no outstanding fees, then they are able to check out the book. If the above are not true, then the guest is not allowed to check out the book and proceed. 
FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
 IF guest.accountActive THEN
     IF NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) THEN
         IF guest.outstandingFees = 0 THEN
           APPEND book to guest.books
           SET book.status to "Checked Out"
           PRINT "Your books have been issued."
         END IF
     END IF
 ELSE
     PRINT "Unable to check out book."
 END IF
END FUNCTION

c. 
I also don't think this needs any modification. Each function within the BankAccount class is clearly written out, so you can see what each one is executing. 
CLASS BankAccount

 FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET endBalance= balance + amount
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION withdraw(amount)
     IF balance > amount THEN
       SET endBalance = balance -amount
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION creditCardOffer
     IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
         CALL offerCreditCard
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION checkStatus
     IF NOT(customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
         CALL offerCheckingAccount
     END
 END FUNCTION

 ....
 ....
 ....
