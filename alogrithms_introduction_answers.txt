1. Using proper pseudocode, describe the following primitive algorithms: 
- Making coffee 
	FUNCTION makeCoffee {
		FILL coffee pot with water 
		POUR into coffeeMaker 
		MEASURE coffee grounds 
		ADD coffee grounds to coffeeMaker's filter 	
		START coffeeMaker 
		WAIT until coffeeMaker beeps 
	END 
	}
- Washing dishes
	FUNCTION wash {
		POUR soup into sink with dirty dishes 
		FILL sink with water 	
		USE SPONGE to scrub each dirty dish	
		RINSE 
		Let dish dry in dish rack 
	END 
	}
- A choice of your own- scramble eggs	
	FUNCTION scrambleEggs {
		HEAT pan with oil or butter 
		CRACK two eggs into a bowl 
		ADD salt & pepper 	
		BEAT eggs with fork 
		COOK eggs using spatula until done
	END 
	}

2. Name 3 companies who created an algorithm that made them successful. 

UPS applied telematics and algorithms to help make deliveries more efficient. It saves its drivers 85 million miles/year. 

Netflix uses predictive analytics in order to gauge what shows will be most successful with their subscribers. They use and have a lot of data on what people like to watch with their service. 

Match.com uses an algorithm to predict possible matches. They use the stated user preferences but also the browsing activity and patterns of each person. 

3. An algorithm is efficient when it can get the issue resolved or reach the goal within a set time frame without extra steps. It should be done as FAST as it can be. It is inefficient when it requires extra steps, goes off on tangents, or diverts from the original goal/issue- these cause an algorithm to take up extra time.
