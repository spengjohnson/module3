/* ####Questions

>What is object-oriented programming?

A: JavaScript as a language is object-oriented since almost everything in JavaScript
can be counted as an object. Objects can have related code and data, which represents
the information about the item you are trying to model. Data related to the object can be stored neatly inside
of an object package to make it easy to structor and access. In a way, it is like packaging
information into tupperware or containers so that they are neatly stored and organized.

>What is a constructor?

A: A constructor is method used in order to create or initialize a new class. There can only
be one constructor in the class.

>What is the purpose of the keyword super?

A: A super is used in the case of the child of a parent class. It is a keyword that is used
to call on variables and functions that are within the parent class. Child classes
can be created with the keyword 'extends'.

>What are classes that do not use the keyword extends called?

A: They are simply classes.

####Code
Using the Clothes class we previously created, create a shirt class that extends
the Clothes class. Don't forget the super().

class Clothes {
	constructor(name, size, price) {
		this.name = name;
		this.size = size;
		this.price = price;
    }
	info() {
		console.log("Here's the clothes info: " + this.name, this.size, this.price);
    }
}

class Shirt extends Clothes {
	info() {
		super.info();
		console.log("Are you going to buy this? " + this.name, this.size, this.price);
    }
}

var blouse = new Shirt('blouse', 'small', 25);
blouse.info();
