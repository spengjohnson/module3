\f0\fs24 \cf0 >In your own words, explain the React core concept of encapsulation. Discuss why this React principle is important in application development. \
\
A: Encapsulation is related to components, which is the backbone of React. When making components, you can use the ES6 classes and gain all of the encapsulating features- properties, methods, etc. React does favor encapsulation over inheritance. Each component that contains a state is encapsulated so that it maintains its state. When data is going to change, we must use state. Bear in mind that a state can change but only within the component that it resides - this is due to the encapsulation concept that carries through due to the components within React. This principle is important because it supports having a collection of code that is reusable. It helps with building applications with reusable \'93pieces\'94 and can essentially make the creation of apps much easier. You can therefore leave certain parts static (props) and other parts are mutable (state); this allows us to customize to our needs. }
